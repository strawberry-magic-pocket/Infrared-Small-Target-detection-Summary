# Infrared-Small-Target-detection-Summary
This is a summary of infrared small target detection algorithms in single-frame infrared images.  
## DataSets
- [SIRST](https://github.com/YimianDai/sirst): SIRST is a dataset for single-frame infrared small target detection. As far as I know, it is the only open dataset and they provided the images with five kinds of annotations to support image classification, instance segmentation, bounding box regression, semantic segmentation, and instance spoting.
